# Intermittent Firestore Data Write Failure in Firebase

This repository demonstrates a bug where data is not consistently written to a Firestore database, even with proper error handling in place. The issue is intermittent, making diagnosis challenging.

## Bug Description
The `set()` method of the Firestore client library appears to function correctly, but data is not persistently stored in the database. This occurs sporadically, making it difficult to isolate the root cause.

## Potential Causes
Several factors may contribute to this problem, including:

* **Network Connectivity:** Temporary network interruptions might prevent data from reaching the Firestore server.
* **Firebase Server Issues:** Server-side problems within Firebase's infrastructure could cause occasional write failures.
* **Concurrency Issues:** Concurrent writes from multiple clients might lead to data loss or inconsistencies, although proper error handling should mitigate this.
* **Security Rules:** Incorrectly configured Firestore security rules could block write attempts.

## Solution
The provided solution includes improved error handling and data write retry logic to increase resilience to transient network issues and intermittent Firebase server problems.
